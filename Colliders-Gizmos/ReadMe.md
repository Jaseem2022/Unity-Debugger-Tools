# Unity Debugger Tools â€“ Collider Gizmos & Physics Visualizer

This project is part of a collection of **Unity Debugger Tools** designed to improve workflow, visualization, and debugging in Unity projects. These tools are lightweight, editor/play mode friendly, and demonstrate core Unity concepts such as physics, vectors, and editor scripting.

## âœ¨ Features

### **1. Collider Gizmos (Editor Mode)**

Draws useful information in the Scene view while editing:

* âœ… Distinguishes between **Kinematic** and **Dynamic Rigidbodies**.
* âœ… Visualizes **Colliders** (Box, Sphere, Capsule).
* âœ… Marks **IsTrigger** colliders with labels.
* âœ… Displays **Tags** above objects.
* âœ… Finds and lists all **attached scripts** on GameObjects.

---

### **2. Physics Visualizer (Play Mode)**

Draws real-time physics vectors in the Scene view during Play mode:

* âœ… **Velocity vectors** (green = acceleration, red = deceleration).
* âœ… **Force vectors** computed using Newtonâ€™s Second Law:
  [
  F = m \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
  ]
* âœ… Updates dynamically based on Rigidbody motion.
* âœ… Uses vector math principles to demonstrate physics behaviors (e.g., centripetal force in circular motion).

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone/download this repo.
2. Place the desired folder (e.g., `Collider-Gizmos`) into your Unity projectâ€™s `Assets` directory.
3. Add the relevant script to an empty GameObject.
4. Open **Scene view** in Unity:

   * Editor Mode â†’ Collider Gizmos appear automatically.
   * Play Mode(In scene mode) â†’ Physics vectors update in real-time.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?

* Demonstrates **editor scripting** (using Gizmos & Handles).
* Reinforces **physics concepts** (velocity, acceleration, force vectors).
* Beginner-friendly but still shows **AAA-valued debugging techniques**.
* Useful for your **portfolio** and **workflow improvement** in Unity.
